  "text": "I have picked a deal by my own, I did it manually. I have been searching with a friend of mine for a ski deal and he cancelled, but I was into it either way. Even it was my first experience and I want to do it properly. I was searching up in some forums and some articles about the people experience and tried to get some insight and how to make it properly, how to make it as efficient and make it as convenient as possible. I have found a person, another friend that could fit into my deal and to join to my vacation. He also had one and we did it manually. So it was a friend from the Facebook, I don't really know him before it. And we have a dial and make some contact, communicate about it, what are our expectations, and how we're going to fit each other into the vacation, make it fun and make it available that both of us can make what we ever want. It was actually a match. We did the same perspectives. And we did it all by our own. We make it as low cost as possible, low price. We searched for flights and did some comparison between the landings and the brand of companies of the airlines. and even we take the transactions by our own and talk with some taxi that should be take us from the airport and which hotel that we want because it's like there is some skin in skin out and some other features that could be fitting depends on the person that you will like. Skin-in-skin-out is just that you, from the thought itself, you can get directly into your room, into your hotel, and you don't have to take other lifts and bus and stuff. So we did it properly, and as efficient as possible, and from then I did some more vacation. It was, like, very inspired, and I really enjoyed it.",
