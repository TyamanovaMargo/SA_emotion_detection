  "text": "I'm not such a big fan of astrology. There's not any evidence that's exposed enough to us to include it in our science facts. I've read some newspapers and some insights about it and I've seen that there's some bias about it because you're grouping by a group of people about this birthright, birthday and make it not personalization and it's not so professional and not enough information and feature related to make us make such assumptions. I believe in other stuff that make us admire and understand more than ever and In general, it's not enough, in my opinion, as a personal insight, my personal beliefs.",
