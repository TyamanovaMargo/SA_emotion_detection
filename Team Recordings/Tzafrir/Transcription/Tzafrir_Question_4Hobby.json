  "text": "Recently, I've reached out to a new hobby, which is in the fly box is artificial free diving. In general, I like to do some sport and extreme sports specifically, which is not so common and could fit into the schedule. I've searched for it and I picked a deal about it. which is with the instructor who fits you into the right position to not mess it up. And it really makes me connect to my mind and be chill and to understand the body position and how to make it really connected and to be motivated to the new skill and feel the most control that I can in the situation. And it makes me feel like confidence. And it's very inspired me to do some of this stuff that's out of mind, out of box. And to kind of think how to make new stuff more than over.",
