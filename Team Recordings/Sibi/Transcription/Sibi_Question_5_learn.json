  "text": "One experience that significantly changed my perspective on life was learning about the concept called Ikigai. It's a Japanese term that means reason for being. I came across it while reading a book on personal fulfillment. Ikigai is found at the intersection of what you love to what you are good at, 3. What the world needs and 4. What you can be built for. So this concept made me rethink my career and personal goals, shifting my focus from just earning a living to finding deeper meaning and satisfaction in my work. It led me to pursue projects and hobbies that align with my passions and strengths, ultimately bringing more joy and purpose to my everyday life. this is pretty much the very reason i am starting this new youtube channel",
