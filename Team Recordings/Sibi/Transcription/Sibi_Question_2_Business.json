  "text": " If I were to start a business right now, I would be starting an entertainment zone. As in I will be dedicating this as a village where people get to and spend time with their loved ones and have a lot of fun. We will be having everything with respect to games. It could be futsal stadiums or go-karting tracks, arcades. We could have refreshments. We can have restaurants within the establishment so that people can hang out and chill as well. Now this particular hub, I would be placing it in such a position where it is not too far from the city so that people get there in the weekends and just have a fun time altogether.",
