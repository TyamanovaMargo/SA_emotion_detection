{"text":" I don't really believe in astrology because I view it as neither realistic nor scientific. And astrology offers generalized statements that can be applied to almost anyone and which diminishes its credibility for me. And people often turn to astrology during difficult times for comfort and motivation, using it as a way to externalize responsibility for their destinies. While it may be similar to forecasting, it lacks the certainty and the specificity that I value. So it has never resonated with me on a personal level. So yeah, I don't really believe in it.",
