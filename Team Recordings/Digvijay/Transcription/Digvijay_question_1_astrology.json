  "text": "I don't believe in it because most of the marriages in the Indian society are done based on astrologers' opinions like when to do them, where to do them. Whether to do them. Whether the bride and groom. Are perfect match. For one another. And. Yeah. So. And. Some of them fail. And that's why. I believe in it. I had a personal experience. Related to this. When my cousin was getting married. She said their parents decided to go to ask. Astrologer whether they should marry with the person that they have selected for her so they the astrologer said that yeah and they are a good match and when there were some conflicts in their marriage and my cousin's parents they went to for to the same astrologer asking whether uh why is it not working what should we do now something like that so he replied that i uh it was not a good match i said it because her marriage was not uh uh happening like there was no perfect man she was not finding uh a groom for uh last two years that's why i lied about it and it also depends on how you behave with another so uh yeah so that changed the perspective of uh her and her husband also husband's also he they're they're good now like they are happily married now and yes also scientific I think astrology is scientific for telling the time like earlier in our culture it was used to tell the time or the based on the positions of the planets relative positions of the planets at the time of birth a date or some major event like uh like weddings uh something like that so so it is just i think it's just for timing purpose and uh so some people started to abuse that power like telling the timing and based on the events that had happened on the same relative position of the planets or the same position of the some planets to to gain some money or power to predict the future of others by predicting the future of others. That's it, yeah.",
