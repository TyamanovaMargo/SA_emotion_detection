  "text": "I'll produce fruits and sell them organic fruits because most of the fruits which are cultivated using chemical fertilizers are not healthy for us also the farmers use who use chemical fertilizers don't use PPE in India most of them don't use PPE PPE is personal protective equipment that's why they get cancer this is a fact because in our district there is a block named Shiror which is highest which produces highest agricultural output like it which gives highest agricultural output it has a number of highest number of farmers who get cancer also so there is high correlation between using chemical fertilizers without PPE and getting cancer so that that's why I want to produce organic fruits which are healthy who produce them and who consume them uh yeah and yeah all the fruit i will offer all the fruits and i know that fruits are perishable so if some fruits get near to the their shelf life i will convert them to the other secondary products like jam ketchup purees and store increase their shelf life and So yeah I would differentiate the product based on the organic quality of that like most of the products which are organic are very good in quality they have some good contents in them. and planting some trees will help reduce global warming by reducing the carbon dioxide in our atmosphere okay that's it",
