  "transcript": " I had such experience and we with my wife and me we were faced with several options because we had we have been trying to find out the best way and the best price to quality ratio in our in our vacations so by the way the most important thing is this place must must be interesting for both of us and it's the most important thing and the next is i think that the history of this place or something like this like something you can you can see you can feel like not the new uh the newest places like uh uh city in london For example, just skyscrapers. And it looks good, but it's not the thing that we are trying to find in other countries while we're traveling. So, yeah, I would say that the first thing is it must be interesting for both of us. And the second is historical heritage. And, yeah.",
